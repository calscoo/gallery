I'm a visual storyteller, driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of artistic expression. I capture the world around us through various means, then transform it into surreal and captivating multimedia assemblages. From the vastness of the cosmos to the intricate details of architecture, every image captured becomes a canvas for my imagination. With a blend of photography, 3D modeling, and digital artistry, I create one-of-a-kind pieces that challenge perception and ignite curiosity. I believe that art is a journey of discovery, a constant evolution of ideas and techniques, and an opportunity to see the world through a kaleidoscope of perspectives. My work reflects this philosophy, blending traditional photography with digital innovation to craft unique and captivating visual stories. Whether capturing the raw beauty of nature or constructing intricate dreamscapes, my goal is to create works that evoke emotion, spark conversation, and leave a lasting impression.

That being said, it took me years to find my niche. After graduating highschool I purchased my first proper camera and shot photos quite literally every day for nearly three months. I was taking pictures of anything and everything. I even took photos of weight racks in the dark and empty gym I worked at after closing up. Why? Well, because who else would think to photograph something so odd? Eventually I got a feel for the camera settings and general best practices for post proccessing. Eventually I reached a point where I felt confident enough in my skills to start taking on portrait clients. A dozen or so successful sessions later and I started to grow bored of what I was making. Sure, my clients were satisfied with the results, but I was loosing the passion for photography that I felt when starting out scrappy. My hobby became a job; it was lucrative, but at what cost? After some careful consideration I quit creating for my clients and started creating for myself. I went back to my roots and resumed shooting whatever the hell I fealt like; the feeling of breaking loose the shackles of creativity is indescribable.

No longer bound, I began to explore the limits of photography. Well past midnight and miles away from light pollution, I tried my hand at shooting the Milky Way. Not long after that I purchased my first camera drone, which opened up an entirely new creative perspective. Finally, one night while processing some images in Photoshop, I mistakenly layered two images on top of each other. Little did I know this single event would become a critical pivot point in my artist journey. From that night forward, I couldn't stop seeing the world through abstract shapes and textures. Everywhere I looked harboured new ideas and an opprotunity to create. My spin on photography and digital art cannot be easily painted into a corner, and that bothered me for years, but I've finally learned to accept and cherish that fact.
